## Exploring synesthesia of audio pitch and colour

Openframeworks app exploring audio synthesis and the phenomenon synethesia

Requires the Maximillian Openframeworks [addon](https://github.com/micknoise/Maximilian)

This app is a simple software synthesiser and note visualiser. I have mapped the musical notes from A0 to G#7 to a colour value so each of the twelve musical pitches in an octave has its own colour. This was done by mapping the pitch array index (from 0 to 11) to a Hue value. I displayed the notes as a grid, each line representing an octave. You default to octave 3 and can use the ',' and '.' keys to move down and up and octave.
